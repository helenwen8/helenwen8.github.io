# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  

In the future, I want to make an actual online portfolio, but I don't know where I would build it. 

# About me
My name is Helen (she/her/hers). I am a CMU Heinz MISM (Master in Information Systems Management) student, looking to graduate in Summer 2025!

My passion lies in using both my technical and soft skills to make an impact in the world. I am experienced in software development, as well as technology consulting. 

In my off time, I enjoy dancing. I lead and participate multiple K-Pop dance projects, as well as dance crews in CMU. 


# What I hope to learn
In Telling Stories with Data, I wish to learn... 

- How to effectively create visuals that are appropriate
- Different ways to visualize data, besides the most common histogram, line graph, etc.
- Many more things! Maybe I will actually create my online portfolio to aid my job search...
