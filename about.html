                <h2 class="po-text-red">History</h2>
                <p>Peoples Oakland is a private non-profit agency established by local residents as a community, planning and organizing agency. Originally, the mission was to enhance the integrity of the community through communications and negotiation among residents, merchants and institutional representatives. Peoples Oakland was very successful in its early organizing efforts, leading to the development of several community wide planning structures which still operate today.
                    The Peoples Oakland Mental Health Program was founded in response to the crisis faced by thousands of state mental hospital patients who, through deinstitutionalization programs, were released into the community with few supporters or social connections. Peoples Oakland began to organize former state hospital patients, providing education to support them in advocating for their rights.</p>

                            The Peoples Oakland Reentry program is an expansion of our services that addresses the needs of
                            individuals suffering from severe mental illness that are being released from the Allegheny
                            County Jail. We will assist these individuals in obtaining appropriate treatment, while
                            providing community support and therapeutic support. For individuals who have recently
                            experienced incarceration, this provides them with a new community and social outlet. By
                            changing their social environment, they are more likely to establish healthy daily rhythms, and
                            will be surrounded by other members who are committed to working towards their own recovery
                            goals.
