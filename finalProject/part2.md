# Wireframes / storyboards

I drew out a brief storyboard on my iPad, and implemented most of my vision through my [Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/zPMl95brekqEHZYe/responsive/desktop). 

Note that all the graphs in there are pictures for simple wireframing!

# User research 

## Target audience

My target audience are people who are familiar with coffee, and are somewhat interested in learning more about them.

Luckily, as we are in college, lots of people do drink coffee just to survive. I interviewed people who I know regularly drinks coffee, and who are willing to try variety of coffee (latte, black, etc.)
