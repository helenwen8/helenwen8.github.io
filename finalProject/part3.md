# The final data story

[Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/a-guide-to-choose-your-next-coffee-bean/index.html)


# Changes made since Part II

One big feedback I got from user testings was that the legends were unclear, and there were a lot of data. To remedy that, I added legends and selected only a few coffee beans to reduce clutter and information overload. 

I also realized the acidity score in coffee cupping score does not necessarily indicate higher/lower acidity, but rather, how the acidic taste makes the coffee unique. I can't really use this data to tell beginners what coffee to choose because it is too compliacted. With the time I had, I decided to analyze balance instead of acidity and trying to give out the same information as before. 


## The audience

I want my audience to be people that drink coffee often enough, and are interested in expanding their knowledge on different coffee beans. 

One of the person I user tested was more of a beginner coffee drinker that doesn't know much about coffee at all. Because of that, they were confused by all the terminologies, and also the recommendations on coffee beans. I decided I want to focus on coffee drinkers that are actively interested in trying out more coffee, and made my project more tailored to that concept.

# Final thoughts
> You can summarize any final thoughts / reflections that don't fit well in the previous sections here.  How did it go?  What did you run out of time for, or wish you had a chance to revisit?  What were you most excited about?  Include any final reflections as you think they might help us understand your process.  If you already included such reflections elsewhere, you can delete this section. 

I had a lot of trouble finding good data for my purposes, and eventually I decided to just give up on finding data, and trying to make my limited analysis as good as they could be. In the future, perhaps I should find interesting dataset first before commiting to an idea. 

(Also, I had a really rough Wednesday and Thursday because of some personal issue. My presentation was way below satisfactory. It is on me :c )
