# Final Project: Part 1

## Outline

### Summary

I want to create a blog post on a coffee bean intro to people who want to start enjoying coffee by learning more about different beans and their attributes. 

## Initial Sketches

## Data

[1340 Coffee Quality Reviews](https://github.com/jldbc/coffee-quality-database) webscraped from Coffee Quality Institute's trained reviewers.

Some findings on [2024 Coffee Consumption, Preferences, and Spending](https://www.driveresearch.com/market-research-company-blog/coffee-survey/)

## Method & Medium

For this project, I plan to present in a blog format, with visualizations mainly created with Tableau. I like Tableau for how clean and interactive it is. Some classmates suggested using Shorthand for potentially more interesting visualization, so I will look into that as well.
