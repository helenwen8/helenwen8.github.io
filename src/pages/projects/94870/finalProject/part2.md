# Wireframes / storyboards

I drew out a brief storyboard on my iPad, and implemented most of my vision through my [Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/zPMl95brekqEHZYe/responsive/desktop). 

Note that all the graphs in there are pictures for simple wireframing!

# User research 

## Target audience

My target audience are people who are familiar with coffee, and are somewhat interested in learning more about them.

Luckily, as we are in college, lots of people do drink coffee just to survive. I interviewed people who I know regularly drinks coffee, and who are willing to try variety of coffee (latte, black, etc.)


## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |

| Ensuring my visualization are clear despite the huge amount of data | What did you think of the visualization? |
|                                                                     | What did you learn from these visualizations? |
| Ensuring my story is compelling.                    | What is your next step? |


## Interview findings


| Questions               | Interview 1 (F, 22yrs, student) | Interview 2 (F, 20yrs, student) | Interview 3 (F, 21yrs, student) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| What did you learn? | They weren't sure what the names on some coffee bean bag is, and now they understand they are the subspecies name | Realizing that they didn't liked a coffee becase they are more acidic made them understand their taste profile more | They learned that coffee has a lot more science behind them.
| What would you have hoped to see? | The most popular line of coffee would be cool | Guide on what beans to choose, what kind of coffee type to choose | More about coffee in general, not just coffee bean
| What did you think of the visualization? | Lack of legends are confusing; some graphs are dense | Lack of legends are confusing | Should include alt text because they care about accessibility
| What did you learn from these visualizations? | Learned about different varieties that they saw in coffee shop | Dislikes acidic coffee, so woul avoid the ones mentioned on my website and try the less acidic ones | Realized coffee is a lot more than just frappuccino drink
| What is your next step? | Trying out coffee with more cup points      | Research on what coffee is more aromatic | Research on coffee bean that is recommended from this article|


# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Visualization without legends are very confusing | Implement actual embedded graph onto the page|
| People cared a lot more about acidity and other things than I expected | Implement perhaps more attributes about the coffee so people could learn more |
| Accessibility is important | Implement visualization with better axis and readability, with alt text support |
| Knowledge might be too niche for people that just started with coffee | Either tailor my story towards more experienced coffee drinker, or make the content more beginner friendly |

Overall, I was happy that people cared about this content more than I thought, even with people that doesn't drink coffee as seriously. I realized that they would care about the attributes of each coffee and would research upon them. Because of this, I want to implement these research. I would also work on making my stories more polished so they are ready for a bigger audience.
