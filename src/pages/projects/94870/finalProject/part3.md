# The final data story

[Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/a-guide-to-choose-your-next-coffee-bean/index.html)

# Changes made since Part II

One big feedback I got from user testings was that the legends were unclear, and there were a lot of data. To remedy that, I added legends and selected only a few coffee beans to reduce clutter and information overload. 

I also realized the acidity score in coffee cupping score does not necessarily indicate higher/lower acidity, but rather, how the acidic taste makes the coffee unique. I can't really use this data to tell beginners what coffee to choose because it is too compliacted. With the time I had, I decided to analyze balance instead of acidity and trying to give out the same information as before. 


## The audience

I want my audience to be people that drink coffee often enough, and are interested in expanding their knowledge on different coffee beans. 

One of the person I user tested was more of a beginner coffee drinker that doesn't know much about coffee at all. Because of that, they were confused by all the terminologies, and also the recommendations on coffee beans. I decided I want to focus on coffee drinkers that are actively interested in trying out more coffee, and made my project more tailored to that concept.

# Final thoughts

I had a lot of trouble finding good data for my purposes, and eventually I decided to just give up on finding data, and trying to make my limited analysis as good as they could be. In the future, perhaps I should find interesting dataset first before commiting to an idea. 

Also, I had a really rough Wednesday and Thursday because of some personal issue. My presentation was way below satisfactory. That is on me :c
